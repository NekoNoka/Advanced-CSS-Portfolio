            <div>
              Our world of pixels is a website utilizes the collective efforts of anyone joining to draw whatever they
              want, or they can act selfishly and ruin other peoples works.
            </div>
            <div>
              The original purpose of my addon is to assist artists in the environment of our world of pixels so they
              can draw without being griefed on.
            </div>
            <div>
              As time went on I've added many more features than just to assist artists from being griefed on such as
              <ul>
                <li>line gradient</li>
                <li>copy&paste</li>
                <li>paste patterns</li>
                <li>changing the draw size</li>
                and much more
              </ul>

              The pixel manager will simply handle pixels being placed, whether someone griefs your work or you decide
              to paste something the pixel manager will place the pixels down automatically.<br>

              automatically place the pixels.

          <div>
            <div>
              We made a website to handle multiple movie database api's to compare the results.<br>
              Unfortunately this idea never would've worked since the task of storing movies and making custom reviews for many of the relevant and current movies out there would be incredibly difficult, thus only a handful of websites exist and most wouldn't provide an api via chance.
